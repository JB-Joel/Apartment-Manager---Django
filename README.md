## Apartment Manager _(Django)_
_Work in Progress_. <br>A full web app to manage rental apartments, keep track of financial details, and provide visual reports of payment history. I used django for the backend and plan to use react to improve UI responsiveness and design. I'm currently using the python built-in SQLite database for storing/retrieving user information. I will later connect to a postgreSQL for scaling purposes. I also use Django's bulit-in authentication tools to implement user account creations, password resets and logins.
<br>After creating a user account, the landloard or apartment manager can perform the following tasks:
- Create and add apartments (specify apartment details like number of rooms, and features included)
-  set rent amount for different apartment types
-  view apartments' status _(occupied, available)_
-  Add tenants to apartments
-  Store records of previous and current apartment owners
-  View tenant standing and payment due dates
-  create visual reports of payment history
#### Prospective features
- A communication system (email/text) for managers to be able to send announcements/messages to all/individual tenants
- Notify tenants of bad standing? (tenants facing possible eviction?)
- 
<b>Goal:</b> Eliminate the need of a traditional pen and paper spreadsheet to keep track of paymentsfor rent and still use a pen and paper to keep track of tenants and financial records. This
